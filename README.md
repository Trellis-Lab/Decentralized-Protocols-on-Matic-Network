# Decentralized-Protocols-on-Matic-Network
To enable a set of decentralized protocols on the Matic Network to make it easy for decentralized app (DApp) developers to reuse this functionality in their DApps just like on Ethereum, rather than reinventing the wheel.

## List of the Protocols

1. **Kyber** (source code, white paper) - On-chain protocol for decentralized token swaps and for easy application integration
2. **Uniswap** (source code, white paper) - "Public good"-oriented interface for ERC-20 token exchange with zero rent-extraction.
3. **Augur** (source code, white paper) - Prediction market protocol to enable anyone to "create and speculate on derivatives at a low cost for the first time"
4. **dYdX** (source code, white paper) - Margin-trading and options protocols
5. **bZx** (source code, docs) - Decentralized margin-lending protocol
